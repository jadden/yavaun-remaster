# War Wind Remaster Project

## Overview
The War Wind Remaster project aims to breathe new life into the classic strategy game by enhancing its lore, mechanics, and overall gameplay experience. This remaster will preserve the original's essence while incorporating modern improvements, expanded world-building, and deeper customization options.

## Features Todo
- **Enhanced Lore**: Introducing detailed backstories and settings for significant locations.
- **Improved Clan System**: Personalize your race's leader and clan name, with future expansions allowing customization of clan colors and unique abilities.
- **Decorative Buildings**: Construct decorative structures that increase influence when built and decrease it when destroyed. These structures have minimal health (10-20) and may have functional roles, such as lampposts serving as observation towers.
- **Scenario Traits**: Implement customizable scenario traits that can modify gameplay. For example, in the Shama'Li campaign, players can activate periodic patrols of Tha'Roon along ancient stone roads.
- **Clan Customizations**: Add special traits and unique abilities to each raceâ€™s clan for enhanced gameplay diversity.
